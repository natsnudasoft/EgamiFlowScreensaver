### Images Settings
#### Add Image
Allows you to select a new image file to add to the list of images that will be randomly selected
when images are created.

#### Remove Image
Removes the selected image file from the list of images that will be randomly selected when images
are created.

#### Image Emit Rate
The number of new images that will be created by the screensaver per second.

#### Max Image Emit Count
The maximum number of images that will be created by the screensaver; when this number of images
are floating around the screen, the screensaver will stop creating new images.

#### Image Emit Location
The location that images will be emitted at on the screensaver; possible values are described
in the following table:

| Value          | Description                                                                                                                             |

#### Manage Emit Behaviours

Displays a window allowing you to manage various effects and behaviours that can be applied to any
images emitted by the screensaver. This window contains a list of available behaviours that you can
enable by ticking the relevant checkbox; a description of the selected behaviour is shown underneath
the list.

[<img src="./resources/EgamiFlowApplyBehaviorsConfiguration.png" alt="Egami Flow Apply Behaviours Configuration Screenshot" />](./resources/EgamiFlowApplyBehaviorsConfiguration.png?raw=true)

##### Configure Behaviour
Configure the selected behaviour in the behaviours list, if it has any configuration options; the
behaviour must be enabled before you are able to configure it.

### Background Settings
#### Desktop
The screensaver will take a screenshot of the current desktop and use that as the background.
<sub>*(This setting does not currently work on Windows 8 and up; preview mode works fine, however
when the screensaver actually runs, a grey background shows instead.)*</sub>

#### Solid Colour
The screensaver will display a chosen colour as the background. The colour to be displayed can be
selected by clicking the *Choose Colour* button.

#### Image
The screensaver will display a chosen image as the background. The image to be displayed can be
selected by clicking the *Choose Image* button. You may also specify the colour to be displayed
behind this image by clicking the *Choose Colour* button.

##### Image Position
How the screensaver will position the chosen background image; possible values are described
in the following table:

| Value   | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Centre  | The image will remain centred at its original size.                                                                                                                |
| Fill    | The image will scale up or down to the minimum possible size required to fill the entire background, maintaining the images original aspect ratio.                 |
| Fit     | The image will scale up or down to the maximum possible size required to display the entire image on the background, maintaining the images original aspect ratio. |
| Stretch | The image will scale to the same size as the background area, ignoring the images original aspect ratio.                                                           |
| Tile    | The image will be repeated across the screen at its original size.                                                                                                 |
